1.  The .product method will modify arr to blend the original array
    with a new Array consisting of [1, 2, 3].  Then arr.first.last
    selects the first array in the array ["b", 1] and then selects
    the last item in this array which is 1. 1 is passed as an 
    argument into the .delete method which is acting on the first
    item in the array.  What is returned is "1" which is the deleted
     item from the first nested array ["b", 1].  The value of array 
    is the same as it was after the .product method transformed it
    except the first item is now ["b"] instead of ["b", 1].

2. This time the .product method returns a 2D arrat that consists of 
   [["b", [1, 2, 3]], ["c", [1, 2, 3]]].  arr.first.last selects for
   [1, 2, 3] and passes that as an argument into the .delete method
   that is operating on the first item in the array.  This will return
   [1, 2, 3] since that was what was being deleted and modify the array
   such that the first item will be ["b"]
