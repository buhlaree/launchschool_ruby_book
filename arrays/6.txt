So the intent of the code is to replace 'margaret' with 'jody'.  But
when 'margaret' is passed in as the index value to target there is 
error since indices are integers.  So a fix could be that we use the
.index method on the names array to get the index value for 'margaret'
 and then pass that index value in to be replaced with 'jody'

names[names.index('margaret')] = 'jody'
